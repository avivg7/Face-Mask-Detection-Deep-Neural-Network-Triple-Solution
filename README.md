# Face-Mask-Detection-Deep-Neural-Network-Triple-Solution
Three types of solutions to the Mask-Detection problem where the first is presented in the form of a convolution network, the second in a network that is fully connected and the third is based on a transfer network. All of them are based Tensorflow keras.
