# Face-Mask-Detection-Deep-Neural-Network-Triple-Solution
Three types of solutions to the Mask-Detection problem where the first is presented in the form of a convolution network, the second in a network that is fully connected and the third is based on a transfer network. All of them are based Tensorflow keras.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    This report describes the mask detection problem and its solution. It contains three configurations that describe three different neural networks: the first, a Fully Connected Network. The second, transfer-learning based network and the third, a Convolutional neural network. 
In this report you will find the complete process of solving this problem using the models described above and additional information such as graphs, code lines screenshots, Loss vs Validation, and other ML concepts that will contribute to the understanding of our project.

    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    The data used for training the model contains 10,000 images which half of them shows a person with a face-mask and the other half non-masked faces.The data we are using contains a validation set, with 1000 pictures, 500 masked-faces and 500 non-masked faces.
The third set, used for testing the model, contains 1000 pictures, 500 masked-faces and 500 non-masked faces.
